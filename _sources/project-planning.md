# Project Planning

_Pre-project_

A project requires some advanced planning to make it a success. Key elements include:

**Assessing suitability:** A meeting between the potential student and supervisor to discuss potential projects and determine whether a project could be of mutual interest and feasible. It can be helpful to consider what the student would like to get out of a project, what the supervisor can provide, and what resources (_e.g._ data) would be required.

**Identifying a research question:** This should ideally be of interest to both the student and supervisor. It should also provide a helpful line of investigation: helping the student to gain experience and skills, and helping the supervisor with their wider research.

**Ensuring everything is ready for the project:** It is important to ensure that everything is in place for the project. Consider: ethical approvals, data availability, additional collaborators.
