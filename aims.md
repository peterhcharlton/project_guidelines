Aims
=======================

I tend to have three aims when supervising students on research projects:
1. To provide students with experience at each stage of a research project.
2. To equip students with essential skills for conducting scientific research.
3. To provide opportunity to perform novel research which could impact healthcare.

As a supervisor, it is important to support the student in achieving the learning objectives specifically set for the research period. In the case of a [student-selected component](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/doctors/medical-school/medical-student-selected-components-sscs) project, SSCs can allow students:
- "An opportunity to study in greater depth an area of their choosing that is outside but which complements the core curriculum."
- "A greater control over learning and the development of self-directed learning skills including critical thinking and reasoning which would engender an approach to medicine that is questioning and self-critical."
- "To develop greater confidence in their own skills and abilities."
- "To present the results of their work verbally, visually, in writing or a combination of these."
- "To develop and recognise the value of transferable skills."
- "To consider potential career paths."
