## Purpose
- Is the purpose of the literature review clearly stated (preferably in an introduction)?

## Identifying relevant literature
- Is the search methodology clearly reported, including databases / search engines, search terms, and the process for selecting publications for inclusion in the review?
- How appropriate is the search methodology for the purposes of the literature review?
- Have multiple databases / search engines been used?
- Has any manual searching been performed (_e.g._ looking at reference lists of publications, consulting other researchers)

## Synthesising evidence
- How well has the evidence been synthesised?
- Are key messages identified from the literature?
- Are studies suitably appraised by highlighting their relevance to the project whilst appreciating their limitations?

## Relevance to the project
- Does the review cover the key topics for the project? _Consider the following topics:_
   - Background to the clinical problem being tackled.
   - Current approaches to tackle the problem.
   - Potential future research directions to address the problem.
- Does the review help inform the choice of research questions?
- Does the review help inform the experimental design?
- Does the review provide sufficient motivation for the project?

## Referencing
- Is a list of references provided using suitable referencing formatting?
- Are references correctly cited in the text?
- Are references appropriately used to support points made in the text?

## Style
Is the review well written? _Consider:_
- Does the review contain an introduction and conclusion?
